The Vials started back in 2016 as a way to bring a selection of loops to life. These musical ideas had been created by Tom Phelan throughout various flatshares in London, collected on a Boss RC-50 that had seen life during a <a href="https://fairstone.bandcamp.com/">previous musical outing</a>.
  <br><br>
Tom met guitarist Matt Knowles through a mutual friend, and Matt amusingly recounts their first meeting like a 'first date' where they shared their musical tastes and experiences over weeknight pints.
<br><br>
Tom then recruited longtime friend and musical collaborator Mike Ruane to play drums, who in turn brought in Jonny Rankin on bass.
  <br><br>
After a few gigs in London, the band – at that point called Phelanto & The Vials – recorded an entire album as their first release. <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5y0WOCq47KcQgJC9ELv9E7">Perudo</a></i>, coming in at nearly an hour in length, showcased a band that were still exploring their sound, and produced early fan favourites Cloud of Steam, My New Girl and Arctic Defender –
songs that have been live stalwarts since their release.
  <br><br>
The band would go on to win a media industry band competition, organised by digital advertisers Captify, and held at Omeara. This put them in front of a judging panel that included Mumford & Son's Ben Lovett (who told the band to quit their day jobs) and Communion's Mazin Tappuni, who would subsequently play Cloud of Steam on his Radio X show.
A gig for Communion's New Music Nights at Notting Hill Arts Club followed, then further gigs supporting Low Island, Martha Ffion and other rising artists.
  <br><br>
By 2018 it was time to get back in the studio, so the band decamped to Cambridge to record the <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4uHqtTGQgm8daV7FktJvjt">Still EP</a></i>, again calling on Matty Moon who produced <i>Perudo</i>. The EP contains the diverse sound palette heard on the preceding album, but it is more focused. Songs Microdosing, Best of Us, Black Sheep and Mute Slate have seen many-a live outing, the band often ending on Still, with its rousing, bouncing finish.
  <br><br>
It was at this point that Phelanto & The Vials became simply The Vials. No longer was this one man and a few loops. It was a democratic, mutually creative group, and the name change reflected that.
  <br><br>
The extent of The Vials does not end at the four band members though. Fiercely independent, the band have put on several gigs entirely themselves, bringing in artists that have a similar ethos and – of course – create interesting music. Such acts include Organised Scum, Oh Man The Mountain, Videocean, Foxes & Hedgehogs, China Bowls, Lethargic Phoenix, and more. All these artists are part of the Vials' journey up to now.
  <br><br>
And what now? The band thankfully survived a Covid-induced confidence wobble and is now back writing music again. Self-released single Tinted Lenses dropped on 1st January 2023, and was celebrated with a show at The Castle in Aldgate, London.
  <br><br>
If you've read this far, thanks for also being on the journey with us. We hope to see your face at a gig one day :)

  <font size="-0.5"><i>20th February 2023</i> – Tom</font>
<br><br>
We did it! We played a gig, in London, and it was packed. If you were there at The Castle, Aldgate, back in Jan – thank you! It was a wonderful night where we played our newly released material, some old faves, and an unreleased gem called Safety Box. There was a call for 'Stephen' before the encore, which was duly noted.
With the Vials print from the Tinted Lenses cover art hung behind us, we played under our own watchful gaze, which perhaps looked a bit weird until I explained why. There were also some nostalgic anecdotes including the time I plugged the band to Steve Lamacq on the tube. Still waiting on that radio play Steve.
<br><br>
Our self-released single, Tinted Lenses, has been played a few times on Amazing Radio, and several times on their Indie playlists. We're chuffed with that.
<br><br>
We also have a Vials first to share with you. Cian from the excellent and uncompromising arts website Drivll <a href="https://www.drivll.com/post/the-vials">reviewed the show</a> for us. We appreciate his candour, even if he gave Mike a bit too much praise in my view...
<br><br>
We now turn our eyes to our next musical release. Straight after the London gig, Mike and I spent some time laying down the drums for three more tracks, which we hope to release at some point over the next 12 months. Safety Box is one of them, plus two others: one fast, one more mellow.

 Well, there you have it – The Vials have a website. It's self-made, like much of what we do, so please forgive any misformatting. We have some rather good coders in the band, but I – at least the third worst – decided to build it as a personal project, teaching myself a new skill in the process.
 I have always wanted to have a place to showcase what we do; a place away from the algorithms of social media.
  <br><br>
Our last gig was in 2019, which is hard to believe. In the time since then, we have written quite a few songs, three of which we have recorded and will be released in the new year. The artwork, again self-made, has really tested my graphical artist skills, which do not come as easy as music! It has been so great to all meet up post-pandemic and play our songs in a room together.
As a nod to the Marvel film franchise – that I ironically don't really care for – I have called this Vials Phase III. It's much more foot-forward, all guitars facing in the same direction. The impression might be that we have thought about it less than our previous releases, though knowing Jonny, Matt, Mike and myself like I do, that's really not the case.
Either way, we are very excited to release the songs (with our first ever video!) and of course, play them live.
<br><br>
It's funny. I'm already looking towards Phase IV. Such is Vials.

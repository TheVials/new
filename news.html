<br><br>
 Well, there you have it – The Vials have a website. It's self-made, like much of what we do, so please forgive any misformatting. We have some rather good coders in the band, but I – at least the third worst – decided to build it as a personal project, teaching myself a new skill in the process.
 I have always wanted to have a place to showcase what we do; a place away from the algorithms of social media.
  <br><br>
Our last gig was in 2019, which is hard to believe. In the time since then, we have written quite a few songs, three of which we have recorded and will be released in the new year. The artwork, again self-made, has really tested my graphical artist skills, which do not come as easy as music! It has been so great to all meet up post-pandemic and play our songs in a room together.
As a nod to the Marvel film franchise – that I ironically don't really care for – I have called this Vials Phase III. It's much more foot-forward, all guitars facing in the same direction. The impression might be that we have thought about it less than our previous releases, though knowing Jonny, Matt, Mike and myself like I do, that's really not the case.
Either way, we are very excited to release the songs (with our first ever video!) and of course, play them live.
<br><br>
It's funny. I'm already looking towards Phase IV. Such is Vials.
